## TAUS-CLI
A CLI interface for [Tauri Updater Server](https://github.com/KaruroChori/tauri-update-server) to perform back-end operation on the DB.  
It exposes most of the relevant operations for administrative tasks.  

Not yet functional: this tool is still under construction. A beta release will be out soon.

### Configuration
TAUS-CLI requires a `config.json` file stored in `~/.config/taus-cli` with the sequelize parameters used to connect with the DB server in order to operate.  
In `~/.config/taus-cli/templates` it will also generate templates for sequelize via sequelize-auto.
